# Welcome to the contribution guide! ✨

Thank you for being interested in contributing in this project.
Below are multiple topics addressed to help you getting started.

All kinds of contributions are very welcome :) ❤️

## Coding conduct and quality

Whenever you are doing a change, for whatever part of the project it is, please make sure to keep quality standards up.
This means:

- Properly format your code **before** commiting
- Make sure your code works before filing a PR
- Don't spam 
- Optimize your code if possible
- Write comments if your code isn't self-explaining
- Keep it simple! Most things can be simplified by a lot
- Keep it relevant and topic focused
- When including media (e.g. images), make sure they have a proper quality and are readable, proper resolutions, etc.
- And lastly: Use common sense!

> ![WARNING]  
> PRs may be rejected or postponed or subjected to be redone if the quality or function doesn't match our standards.

## Sharing ideas / Feature requests

If you have an idea about a new feature or e.g. some new demo we could do, please open an issue with the proper template or start a discussion.
If you intend to work on this, please state this too!

## Working on a task (issue)

Once you decided on an issue to work on, possibly your own, assign yourself and indicate that you are working on that issue.
This way, we won't get duplicated work for the same issues.

Next, you want to create a branch. I would recommend using the GitHub interface to create a branch as it links issues/PRs with branches directly.
However, if this isn't desired you can instead try to indicate the issue in your branch name. Something like `issue123` or `#123` or `<username>/issue123` etc. ... are good branch names.

Furthermore, try to finish your assigned tasks quickly and try to avoid dropping it mid-way.
If you need more time or some problem occurred, please talk to us.
Others may be able to work on this instead and possibly take on your work.

## Finishing your task (issue)

Once you are done with your task, please validate that it follows our quality standards.

If everything checks out, open a PR (if not already done) or convert your **DRAFT** PR into an actual PR.
If possible, try to ping someone and indicate in the comment that your work is ready for review.

Please allow us some time to review your changes and follow suggested changes by us.
If, for whatever reason, you fail to make changes or stop replying, we will integrate the requested changes ourself (_or assign it to someone else_).
