# Getting started with the demo project

The demo project includes an excellent way of getting started with this project.  
Multiple demos are provided to be played around with and to be build upon on.

First of all, you will need to acquire the demo project.  
There are multiple ways of doing so:

- via [Godot Asset Library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2399)
- via downloading a [Release](releases/)
- via cloning the Repository
- via downloading a ZIP of this repository
- ... and possibly more ...

Chose whatever fits your use-case the best.  
Once you have the demo project going, head to [further Godot setup](./FurtherGodotSetup.md).  
However, keep in mind that you most likely won't need and use all demos that are provided.  
I highly recommend cleaning out any parts that you won't be using.
